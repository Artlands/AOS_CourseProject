TODO LIST FOR GC64-DMC
------------------------------------------------

- write the official packet handler

------------------------------------------------
DONE

!DONE! - write some nice graphing scripts and analysis scripts 

!DONE! - expand the current expiration logic to treat 
  read and write traffic separately.  We need 
  to split read requests on a modulo 128 bytes 
  and any non-contiguous write requests.

!DONE! - fix the bug in the hello_world app runtime, currently segfaults

- !DONE! round the HMC requests up to the next modulo 16

The current HMC trace only looks at the size
recorded in the number of inserted bytes for 
reads and writes, respectively.  This value
needs to be rounded up to next greatest 
power of two number of bytes

_OR_

We need to split the request
into two sub-requests... however, 
this requires more microcode latency 
and more HMC control overhead 

See the code in ./ucode/trace.c
